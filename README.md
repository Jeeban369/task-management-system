A simple **Task Management System** built in Go. This program helps you manage tasks with basic operations like adding, viewing, and deleting tasks. It is beginner-friendly and focuses on clean and straightforward implementation.

## Features

1. **Add Tasks**: Add tasks with a title to your task list.
2. **View Tasks**: Display all tasks with their ID, title, and status (Pending/Completed).
3. **Delete Tasks**: Remove a task from the list using its unique ID.

## Code Overview

### Task Struct
The `Task` struct represents a single task with the following fields:
- `ID` (int): A unique identifier for the task.
- `Title` (string): The description of the task.
- `Done` (bool): Indicates whether the task is completed.

### TaskManager Struct
The `TaskManager` struct manages a list of tasks and contains:
- `tasks` ([]Task): A slice to store tasks.
- `nextID` (int): A counter to generate unique IDs for new tasks.

### Methods

#### `AddTask`
Adds a new task to the task manager.
```go
func (tm *TaskManager) AddTask(title string)
```

#### `ViewTasks`
Displays all tasks with their details.
```go
func (tm *TaskManager) ViewTasks()
```

#### `DeleteTask`
Removes a task by its unique ID.
```go
func (tm *TaskManager) DeleteTask(id int)
```
